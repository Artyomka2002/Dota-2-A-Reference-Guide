# `@remix-run/router`

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- Add support for Lazy Route Discovery (a.k.a. Fog of War) ([#11626](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11626))

  - RFC: <https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/11113>
  - `unstable_patchRoutesOnMiss` docs: <https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router>

## 1.16.1

### Patch Changes

- Support `unstable_dataStrategy` on `staticHandler.queryRoute` ([#11515](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11515))

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a new `unstable_dataStrategy` configuration option ([#11098](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11098))
  - This option allows Data Router applications to take control over the approach for executing route loaders and actions
  - The default implementation is today's behavior, to fetch all loaders in parallel, but this option allows users to implement more advanced data flows including Remix single-fetch, middleware/context APIs, automatic loader caching, and more
- Move `unstable_dataStrategy` from `createStaticHandler` to `staticHandler.query` so it can be request-specific for use with the `ResponseStub` approach in Remix. It's not really applicable to `queryRoute` for now since that's a singular handler call anyway so any pre-processing/post/processing could be done there manually. ([#11377](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11377))
- Add a new `future.unstable_skipActionRevalidation` future flag ([#11098](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11098))
  - Currently, active loaders revalidate after any action, regardless of the result
  - With this flag enabled, actions that return/throw a 4xx/5xx response status will no longer automatically revalidate
  - This should reduce load on your server since it's rare that a 4xx/5xx should actually mutate any data
  - If you need to revalidate after a 4xx/5xx result with this flag enabled, you can still do that via returning `true` from `shouldRevalidate`
  - `shouldRevalidate` now also receives a new `unstable_actionStatus` argument alongside `actionResult` so you can make decision based on the status of the `action` response without having to encode it into the action data
- Added a `skipLoaderErrorBubbling` flag to `staticHandler.query` to disable error bubbling on loader executions for single-fetch scenarios where the client-side router will handle the bubbling ([#11098](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11098))

## 1.15.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix a `future.v7_partialHydration` bug that would re-run loaders below the boundary on hydration if SSR loader errors bubbled to a parent boundary ([#11324](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11324))
- Fix a `future.v7_partialHydration` bug that would consider the router uninitialized if a route did not have a loader ([#11325](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11325))

## 1.15.2

### Patch Changes

- Preserve hydrated errors during partial hydration runs ([#11305](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11305))

## 1.15.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix encoding/decoding issues with pre-encoded dynamic parameter values ([#11199](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11199))

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a `createStaticHandler` `future.v7_throwAbortReason` flag to throw `request.signal.reason` (defaults to a `DOMException`) when a request is aborted instead of an `Error` such as `new Error("query() call aborted: GET /path")` ([#11104](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11104))

  - Please note that `DOMException` was added in Node v17 so you will not get a `DOMException` on Node 16 and below.

### Patch Changes

- Respect the `ErrorResponse` status code if passed to `getStaticContextFormError` ([#11213](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11213))

## 1.14.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix bug where dashes were not picked up in dynamic parameter names ([#11160](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11160))
- Do not attempt to deserialize empty JSON responses ([#11164](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11164))

## 1.14.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix bug with `route.lazy` not working correctly on initial SPA load when `v7_partialHydration` is specified ([#11121](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11121))
- Fix bug preventing revalidation from occurring for persisted fetchers unmounted during the `submitting` phase ([#11102](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11102))
- De-dup relative path logic in `resolveTo` ([#11097](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11097))

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- Added a new `future.v7_partialHydration` future flag that enables partial hydration of a data router when Server-Side Rendering. This allows you to provide `hydrationData.loaderData` that has values for _some_ initially matched route loaders, but not all. When this flag is enabled, the router will call `loader` functions for routes that do not have hydration loader data during `router.initialize()`, and it will render down to the deepest provided `HydrateFallback` (up to the first route without hydration data) while it executes the unhydrated routes. ([#11033](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11033))

  For example, the following router has a `root` and `index` route, but only provided `hydrationData.loaderData` for the `root` route. Because the `index` route has a `loader`, we need to run that during initialization. With `future.v7_partialHydration` specified, `<RouterProvider>` will render the `RootComponent` (because it has data) and then the `IndexFallback` (since it does not have data). Once `indexLoader` finishes, application will update and display `IndexComponent`.

  ```jsx
  let router = createBrowserRouter(
    [
      {
        id: "root",
        path: "/",
        loader: rootLoader,
        Component: RootComponent,
        Fallback: RootFallback,
        children: [
          {
            id: "index",
            index: true,
            loader: indexLoader,
            Component: IndexComponent,
            HydrateFallback: IndexFallback,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
    {
      future: {
        v7_partialHydration: true,
      },
      hydrationData: {
        loaderData: {
          root: { message: "Hydrated from Root!" },
        },
      },
    }
  );
  ```

  If the above example did not have an `IndexFallback`, then `RouterProvider` would instead render the `RootFallback` while it executed the `indexLoader`.

  **Note:** When `future.v7_partialHydration` is provided, the `<RouterProvider fallbackElement>` prop is ignored since you can move it to a `Fallback` on your top-most route. The `fallbackElement` prop will be removed in React Router v7 when `v7_partialHydration` behavior becomes the standard behavior.

- Add a new `future.v7_relativeSplatPath` flag to implement a breaking bug fix to relative routing when inside a splat route. ([#11087](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11087))

  This fix was originally added in [#10983](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/10983) and was later reverted in [#11078](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11078) because it was determined that a large number of existing applications were relying on the buggy behavior (see [#11052](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/11052))

  **The Bug**
  The buggy behavior is that without this flag, the default behavior when resolving relative paths is to _ignore_ any splat (`*`) portion of the current route path.

  **The Background**
  This decision was originally made thinking that it would make the concept of nested different sections of your apps in `<Routes>` easier if relative routing would _replace_ the current splat:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="dashboard/*" element={<Dashboard />} />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
  ```

  Any paths like `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/team`, `/dashboard/projects` will match the `Dashboard` route. The dashboard component itself can then render nested `<Routes>`:

  ```jsx

- "Same hash" navigations no longer re-run loaders to match browser behavior (i.e. `/path#hash -> /path#hash`) ([#10408](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10408))

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Enable relative routing in the `@remix-run/router` when providing a source route ID from which the path is relative to: ([#10336](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10336))

  - Example: `router.navigate("../path", { fromRouteId: "some-route" })`.
  - This also applies to `router.fetch` which already receives a source route ID

- Introduce a new `@remix-run/router` `future.v7_prependBasename` flag to enable `basename` prefixing to all paths coming into `router.navigate` and `router.fetch`.

  - Previously the `basename` was prepended in the React Router layer, but now that relative routing is being handled by the router we need prepend the `basename` _after_ resolving any relative paths
  - This also enables `basename` support in `useFetcher` as well

### Patch Changes

- Enhance `LoaderFunction`/`ActionFunction` return type to prevent `undefined` from being a valid return value ([#10267](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10267))
- Ensure proper 404 error on `fetcher.load` call to a route without a `loader` ([#10345](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10345))
- Deprecate the `createRouter` `detectErrorBoundary` option in favor of the new `mapRouteProperties` option for converting a framework-agnostic route to a framework-aware route. This allows us to set more than just the `hasErrorBoundary` property during route pre-processing, and is now used for mapping `Component -> element` and `ErrorBoundary -> errorElement` in `react-router`. ([#10287](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10287))
- Fixed a bug where fetchers were incorrectly attempting to revalidate on search params changes or routing to the same URL (using the same logic for route `loader` revalidations). However, since fetchers have a static href, they should only revalidate on `action` submissions or `router.revalidate` calls. ([#10344](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10344))
- Decouple `AbortController` usage between revalidating fetchers and the thing that triggered them such that the unmount/deletion of a revalidating fetcher doesn't impact the ongoing triggering navigation/revalidation ([#10271](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10271))

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Added support for [**Future Flags**](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/guides/api-development-strategy) in React Router. The first flag being introduced is `future.v7_normalizeFormMethod` which will normalize the exposed `useNavigation()/useFetcher()` `formMethod` fields as uppercase HTTP methods to align with the `fetch()` behavior. ([#10207](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10207))

  - When `future.v7_normalizeFormMethod === false` (default v6 behavior),
    - `useNavigation().formMethod` is lowercase
    - `useFetcher().formMethod` is lowercase
  - When `future.v7_normalizeFormMethod === true`:
    - `useNavigation().formMethod` is uppercase
    - `useFetcher().formMethod` is uppercase

### Patch Changes

- Provide fetcher submission to `shouldRevalidate` if the fetcher action redirects ([#10208](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10208))
- Properly handle `lazy()` errors during router initialization ([#10201](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10201))
- Remove `instanceof` check for `DeferredData` to be resilient to ESM/CJS boundaries in SSR bundling scenarios ([#10247](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10247))
- Update to latest `@remix-run/web-fetch@4.3.3` ([#10216](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10216))

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- **Introducing Lazy Route Modules!** ([#10045](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10045))

  In order to keep your application bundles small and support code-splitting of your routes, we've introduced a new `lazy()` route property. This is an async function that resolves the non-route-matching portions of your route definition (`loader`, `action`, `element`/`Component`, `errorElement`/`ErrorBoundary`, `shouldRevalidate`, `handle`).

  Lazy routes are resolved on initial load and during the `loading` or `submitting` phase of a navigation or fetcher call. You cannot lazily define route-matching properties (`path`, `index`, `children`) since we only execute your lazy route functions after we've matched known routes.

  Your `lazy` functions will typically return the result of a dynamic import.

  ```jsx
  // In this example, we assume most folks land on the homepage so we include that
  // in our critical-path bundle, but then we lazily load modules for /a and /b so
  // they don't load until the user navigates to those routes
  let routes = createRoutesFromElements(
    <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
      <Route index element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="a" lazy={() => import("./a")} />
      <Route path="b" lazy={() => import("./b")} />
    </Route>
  );
  ```

  Then in your lazy route modules, export the properties you want defined for the route:

  ```jsx
  export async function loader({ request }) {
    let data = await fetchData(request);
    return json(data);
  }

  // Export a `Component` directly instead of needing to create a React Element from it
  export function Component() {
    let data = useLoaderData();

    return (
      <>
        <h1>You made it!</h1>
        <p>{data}</p>
      </>
    );
  }

  // Export an `ErrorBoundary` directly instead of needing to create a React Element from it
  export function ErrorBoundary() {
    let error = useRouteError();
    return isRouteErrorResponse(error) ? (
      <h1>

- Ensure status code and headers are maintained for `defer` loader responses in `createStaticHandler`'s `query()` method ([#10077](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10077))
- Change `invariant` to an `UNSAFE_invariant` export since it's only intended for internal use ([#10066](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10066))

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixes 2 separate issues for revalidating fetcher `shouldRevalidate` calls ([#9948](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9948))
  - The `shouldRevalidate` function was only being called for _explicit_ revalidation scenarios (after a mutation, manual `useRevalidator` call, or an `X-Remix-Revalidate` header used for cookie setting in Remix). It was not properly being called on _implicit_ revalidation scenarios that also apply to navigation `loader` revalidation, such as a change in search params or clicking a link for the page we're already on. It's now correctly called in those additional scenarios.
  - The parameters being passed were incorrect and inconsistent with one another since the `current*`/`next*` parameters reflected the static `fetcher.load` URL (and thus were identical). Instead, they should have reflected the the navigation that triggered the revalidation (as the `form*` parameters did). These parameters now correctly reflect the triggering navigation.
- Respect `preventScrollReset` on `<fetcher.Form>` ([#9963](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9963))
- Do not short circuit on hash change only mutation submissions ([#9944](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9944))
- Remove `instanceof` check from `isRouteErrorResponse` to avoid bundling issues on the server ([#9930](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9930))
- Fix navigation for hash routers on manual URL changes ([#9980](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9980))
- Detect when a `defer` call only contains critical data and remove the `AbortController` ([#9965](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9965))
- Send the name as the value when url-encoding `File` `FormData` entries ([#9867](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9867))

- Reset `actionData` on action redirect to current location ([#9772](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9772))

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Remove `unstable_` prefix from `createStaticHandler`/`createStaticRouter`/`StaticRouterProvider` ([#9738](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9738))

### Patch Changes

- Fix explicit `replace` on submissions and `PUSH` on submission to new paths ([#9734](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9734))
- Fix a few bugs where loader/action data wasn't properly cleared on errors ([#9735](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9735))
- Prevent `useLoaderData` usage in `errorElement` ([#9735](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9735))
- Skip initial scroll restoration for SSR apps with `hydrationData` ([#9664](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9664))

## 1.1.0

This release introduces support for [Optional Route Segments](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/9546). Now, adding a `?` to the end of any path segment will make that entire segment optional. This works for both static segments and dynamic parameters.

**Optional Params Examples**

- Path `lang?/about` will match:
  - `/:lang/about`
  - `/about`
- Path `/multistep/:widget1?/widget2?/widget3?` will match:
  - `/multistep`
  - `/multistep/:widget1`
  - `/multistep/:widget1/:widget2`
  - `/multistep/:widget1/:widget2/:widget3`

**Optional Static Segment Example**

- Path `/home?` will match:
  - `/`
  - `/home`
- Path `/fr?/about` will match:
  - `/about`
  - `/fr/about`

### Minor Changes

- Allows optional routes and optional static segments ([#9650](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9650))

### Patch Changes

- Stop incorrectly matching on partial named parameters, i.e. `<Route path="prefix-:param">`, to align with how splat parameters work. If you were previously relying on this behavior then it's recommended to extract the static portion of the path at the `useParams` call site: ([#9506](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9506))

```jsx
// Old behavior at URL /prefix-123
<Route path="prefix-:id" element={<Comp /> }>

function Comp() {
  let params = useParams(); // { id: '123' }
  let id = params.id; // "123"
  ...
}

// New behavior at URL /prefix-123
<Route path=":id" element={<Comp /> }>

function Comp() {
  let params = useParams(); // { id: 'prefix-123' }
  let id = params.id.replace(/^prefix-/, ''); // "123"
  ...
}
```

- Persist `headers` on `loader` `request`'s after SSR document `action` request ([#9721](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9721))
- Fix requests sent to revalidating loaders so they reflect a GET request ([#9660](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9660))
- Fix issue with deeply nested optional segments ([#9727](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9727))
- GET forms now expose a submission on the loading navigation ([#9695](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9695))
- Fix error boundary tracking for multiple errors bubbling to the same boundary ([#9702](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9702))

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix requests sent to revalidating loaders so they reflect a `GET` request ([#9680](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9680))
- Remove `instanceof Response` checks in favor of `isResponse` ([#9690](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9690))
- Fix `URL` creation in Cloudflare Pages or other non-browser-environments ([#9682](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9682), [#9689](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9689))
- Add `requestContext` support to static handler `query`/`queryRoute` ([#9696](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9696))
  - Note that the unstable API of `queryRoute(path, routeId)` has been changed to `queryRoute(path, { routeId, requestContext })`

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- Throw an error if an `action`/`loader` function returns `undefined` as revalidations need to know whether the loader has previously been executed. `undefined` also causes issues during SSR stringification for hydration. You should always ensure you `loader`/`action` returns a value, and you may return `null` if you don't wish to return anything. ([#9511](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9511))
- Properly handle redirects to external domains ([#9590](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9590), [#9654](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9654))
- Preserve the HTTP method on 307/308 redirects ([#9597](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9597))
- Support `basename` in static data routers ([#9591](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9591))
- Enhanced `ErrorResponse` bodies to contain more descriptive text in internal 403/404/405 scenarios

- Support `basename` and relative routing in `loader`/`action` redirects ([#9447](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9447))
- Ignore pathless layout routes when looking for proper submission `action` function ([#9455](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9455))
- properly support `index` routes with a `path` in `useResolvedPath` ([#9486](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9486))
- Add UMD build for `@remix-run/router` ([#9446](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9446))
- fix `createURL` in local file execution in Firefox ([#9464](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9464))
- Updates to `unstable_createStaticHandler` for incorporating into Remix ([#9482](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9482), [#9465](https://giimport { createDuration } from './create';

function addSubtract(duration, input, value, direction) {
    var other = createDuration(input, value);

    duration._milliseconds += direction * other._milliseconds;
    duration._days += direction * other._days;
    duration._months += direction * other._months;

    return duration._bubble();
}

// supports only 2.0-style add(1, 's') or add(duration)
export function add(input, value) {
    return addSubtract(this, input, value, 1);
}

// supports only 2.0-style subtract(1, 's') or subtract(duration)
export function subtract(input, value) {
    return addSubtract(this, input, value, -1);
}
